        // for primitive types like strings,numbers or booleans, when we copy the value to another variable,and then update the copied variable, the original variable remain unchanged.

        let age=100;
        let age2=age;

        console.log(age,age2);
        age2=12;

        console.log(name,name2);

        name2 = 'manya';
        console.log('new name is:',name2);

        // however,when it comes to an array or an object,things are different.If we update copied array, the original array changes too. The reason is because primitive types are called by VALUE, while objects are called by Refrence . So actually team and players they point to the same array !!
        const players =['atharva','sahil','sunny','arya','amol'];
        const team = players;
        console.log(players,team);

        team[3]='jimjam';
        console.log(players,team);

        // Different ways to copy an array.

        //1. using array.splice() : if we don't pass in any arguments in the slice() method, it just gives us a copy of the original array.
        const team2=players.splice();
        team2[3]='santoor';
        console.log(players,team2);

        //2. using array.concat(): we can also create a new array and concat the old one in.
        const team3 = [].concat(players);
        team3[3] ='Cool';
        console.log(players,team3);
        //3. using ES6 Spread operator(...) The spread operator in ES6 is a very simple way to do it.
        const team4 = [...players];
        team4[3] ='hieeee';
        console.log(players,team4);

        // 4. using Array.from() to create a new array.
        const team5 = Array.from(players);
        team5[3] ='hahaha';
        console.log(players,team5);

        /*DIFFERENT WAYS TO COPY AN OBJECT */
        
        //1. Using object.assign() :
        const person ={
            name: 'atharva',
            age:21
        };
        //In Object.assign() method, we first pass in an empty object,then the object we want to copy,as well as other properties that we want to add to our new object.
        const captain = Object.assign({},person,{number:28});
        console.log(captain);

        // 2. using ES6 spread operator(...)
        const cap2 = {...captain};
        cap2.age = 12;
        console.log(cap2,person);



        // Shallow copy & deep Copy
    // what we need to be careful is that all those methods above are only making a shallow copy of the original array/object.
    // following example, we have a user data which contains a nested object. Let's say we want to make a copy of it and then reassign a twitter account to it.

    const atharva = {
        name:'atharva',
        age:21,
        social:{
            twitter:'@atharva2801',
            facebook:'atharva.developer'
        }
    };
    const dev = Object.assign({},atharva,{name:'manya'});
    dev.social.twitter = '@atharva28';
    console.log(atharva);
    console.log(dev);

    // make a deep copy in js
    // deep copy of an object is a copy whose properties do not share the same regerences(point to the same underlying values) as those of the source object from which the copy was made. As a result,when you change either the source or the copy,you can be assured you're not causing the other object to change too.

    // 1. Using JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object)) : a simple way to do it is by turning an object into a JSON string, and then parse it back to a js object.
    let ingredients_list =["noodles",{list :["eggs","flour","water"]}];
    let ingredients_list_deepcopy =JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(ingredients_list));

    ingredients_list_deepcopy[1].list=["rice flour","water"];

    console.log(ingredients_list[1].list);

    // after changing the value of the 'list property in ingredients_list_deepcopy, the 'list' property does not change in the original ingredients_list.'


    // using structuredClone() : a global method which allows you to create a deep copy of an object. This method is relatively new but it's already supported by all browsers.

    let wizards =[{
        // here we have an array of wizards
        name:'radagast',
        color:'brown',
    }, {
        name:'jimjim',
        color:'black'
    }];
    let wizardsCopy = structuredClone(wizards);
    // Then we push some new data in the copied array and also update the name of the first wizard.

    wizardsCopy.push({
        name:'Goblin',
        color:'blue'
    });
    wizardsCopy[0].name='dragon';

    // when we put out the original wizards array,we will find that all the data remains unchanged.
    console.log(wizards);
    console.log(wizardsCopy);
